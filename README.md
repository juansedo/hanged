# Hanged! - Web Application in PHP

## Introduction

Using the knowledge learned in the course [Building Web Applications in PHP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-applications-php) from Coursera (with Dr. Charles Severance as teacher), I decided to make a small project: a **hangman game**.

At below, I will explain the installation process, as well as how to use it.

## Installation

You must run these files in a PHP server. The fastest way is downloading [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Windows) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) (Windows and Mac) to simulate a server on localhost.

Go to your `htdocs` folder and then download this repository as a [zip file](https://github.com/juansedo/hanged/archive/master.zip) in that folder and unzip it. The `htdocs` folder is in different locations depending on your web server and OS:

**Windows XAMPP:** C:\xampp\htdocs
**Windows MAMP:** C:\MAMP\htdocs
**MAC MAMP:** /Applications/MAMP/htdocs

## Usage

For accessing to webpage, you need to start the web server.

**In XAMPP:**
Click on Start button in front of Apache module.
